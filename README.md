In this repository, you will find all the AI Projects I developed.

**Crossword:**
  Developed an AI to solve a crossword puzzle by choosing the right words that fit the crossword.
  
**Nim:**
  Developed an AI to play the game Nim. The AI will always choose the best move possible. 
  The AI was trained to play Nim by playing a set number of games against itself. 
  
**Tic-Tac-Toe:**
  Developed an AI to never lose at Tic-Tac-Toe. Using the minimax algorithm, the AI will always choose the best move that maximizes its chances of winning.
  
**PageRank:**
Implemented Google's PageRank algorithm on a small sample of web pages. 

**Minesweeper**
Implemented an AI to play Minesweeper. If there are safe moves to play, the AI will choose one of them to play. Otherwise, the AI will play a random move. The AI uses the knowledge it obtained from the current cells on the board to determine which cells are safe and which cells contain bombs.
